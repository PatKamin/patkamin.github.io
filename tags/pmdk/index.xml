The open source PMDK project currently supports ten libraries, which are targeted at various use cases for persistent memory with language support for C, C++, Java*, and Python*. The PMDK also includes tools like the pmemcheck plug-in for the open source toolset, valgrind, and an increasing body of documentation, code examples, tutorials, and blog entries.</description></item><item><title>What programming languages does PMDK (Persistent Memory Development Kit) support?</title><link>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000011-what-languages-does-pmdk-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000011-what-languages-does-pmdk-support/</guid><description>Answer The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) core libraries provide C APIs. Libraries such as libpmemobj provide C++ APIs. Higher level libraries such as libpmemkv, a key-value store for persistent memory, support C, C++, Javascript, Java, Ruby, and Python.</description></item><item><title>Why use PMDK (Persistent Memory Development Kit)?</title><link>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000010-why-use-pmdk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000010-why-use-pmdk/</guid><description>Answer The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) is designed to solve persistent memory challenges and facilitate the adoption of persistent memory programming. It offers developers well-tested, production-ready libraries and tools in a comprehensive implementation of the Storage Networking Industry Association Non-Volatile Memory (SNIA NVM) programming model.</description></item></channel></rss>
