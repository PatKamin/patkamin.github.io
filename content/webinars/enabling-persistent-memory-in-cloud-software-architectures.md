# Brief webinar description
description: 'Intel launched the first generation of Intel® Optane™ persistent memory, and it is widely available from several vendors with full operating system support from both Microsoft Windows*, most Linux* distros, and file systems like ext4, XFS, and NTFS. Persistent memory is a technology that is byte-digestible, like DRAM, and has high capacity non-volatile storage capabilities. So, how do developers leverage persistent memory?'
