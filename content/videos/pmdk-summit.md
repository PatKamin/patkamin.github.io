description: 'PMDK an open-source project hosted by Intel. The introduction of Persistent Memory (PMEM) marks the beginning of a revolution in the computing industry. PMDK is a development kit - a collection of open-source (vendor-neutral) libraries that makes this new paradigm of merging Memory and Storage possible. Persistent Memory (Optane persistent memory) blurs the line between storage and memory by being both byte-addressable as well as persistent.'
