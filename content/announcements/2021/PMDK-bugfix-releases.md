All,

I'm pleased to announce three bugfix releases of PMDK,

You can find source code and ChangeLogs on the following pages:

The major highlight of this release is a fix for a missing sfence in non-temporal version of memcpy function. Here you can find details about this issue: [https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/issues/5292](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/issues/5292)
