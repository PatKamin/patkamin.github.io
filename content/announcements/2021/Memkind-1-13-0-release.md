Hi,

Iâ€™m glad to announce that [memkind](https://memkind.github.io/) 1.13.0 has been released.

Most notably, this release introduces a fixed kind for user-supplied memory area (along with the C++ allocator). Creating a fixed kind can be done by using memkind_create_fixed() function.
This release also includes a new function to get the memory capacity of nodes available to a given kind - memkind_get_capacity().

For more information, see memkind man_page:

[http://memkind.github.io/memkind/man_pages/memkind.html](http://memkind.github.io/memkind/man_pages/memkind.html)

The source code and the release note are available under the following link:

Best Regards,

Patryk
