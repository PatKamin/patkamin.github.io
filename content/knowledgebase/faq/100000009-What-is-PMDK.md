# Answer

The [Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK)](http://pmem.io/pmdk/), formerly known as the Non-Volatile Memory Library (NVML), is a collection of libraries and tools designed to support development of persistent-memory-aware applications. The open source PMDK project currently supports ten libraries, which are targeted at various use cases for persistent memory with language support for C, C++, Java*, and Python*.  The PMDK also includes tools like the pmemcheck plug-in for the open source toolset, valgrind, and an increasing body of documentation, code examples, tutorials, and blog entries.  The libraries are tuned and validated to production quality and are issued with a license that allows their use in both open and closed source products.  The project continues to expand as new use cases are identified.
