# Answer

The [Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK)](http://pmem.io/pmdk/) is designed to solve persistent memory challenges and facilitate the adoption of persistent memory programming. It offers developers well-tested, production-ready libraries and tools in a comprehensive implementation of the [Storage Networking Industry Association Non-Volatile Memory (SNIA NVM) programming model](https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/npm).
