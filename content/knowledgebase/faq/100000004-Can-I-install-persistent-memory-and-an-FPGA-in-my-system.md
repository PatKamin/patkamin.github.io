# Applies To

- Intel® Optane™ Persistent Memory
- NVDIMM-N
- FPGA

# Answer

It is recommended to seek advice from the server OEM/ODM directly. While it is possible to support FPGAs and persistent memory in the same system, several factors need to be considered which include, but are not limited to the following:

- Server size (1U, 2U, 4U, etc)
- Power Supplies
- Internal and external cooling functions - Air cooled, liquid cooled, or hybrid
- The type and quantity of persistent memory modules or devices within the system with their power & thermal requirements
- The make, model, and quantity of the FPGAs with its power and cooling requirements
