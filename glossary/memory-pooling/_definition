In this glossary, we use the term
**Memory Pooling** to refer to the disaggregation of memory into a shared
pool, such that memory could be assigned to different hosts that are
physically connected to the pool.  The reason to use Memory Pooling is
to more efficiently leverage the memory capacity among a group of machines,
avoiding _stranded memory_ where a host's compute resources are exhausted
while having unused memory capacity.  Typically, an _orchestrator_
determines the optimal use of resources in a group of machines, and
with Memory Pooling, that would include the assignment of memory
capacity to individual hosts.

The [CXL](#cxl) 2.0 specification includes some support for Memory Pooling.

Do not confuse this term with [Memory Tiering](#memory-tiering), which is
a different concept.  Memory Pooling is about sharing capacity between
multiple hosts, where Memory Tiering is how a host chooses to use multiple
types of memory available to it.

Note that the term [Memory Pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_pool)
is also in common use and is unrelated to the concept described here.
