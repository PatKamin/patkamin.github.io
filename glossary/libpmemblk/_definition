The **libpmemblk** library
supports arrays of pmem-resident blocks, all the same size, that are
atomically updated. For example, a program keeping a cache of fixed-size
objects in pmem might find this library useful.
The algorithm used by **libpmemblk** is the same as the [BTT](#btt)
algorithm standardized as part of the [UEFI specification](https://uefi.org).
The [PMDK page](https://pmem.io/pmdk/) contains documentation on all
the PMDK libraries, which are open source and available on
[GitHub](https://pmem.io/repoindex).
