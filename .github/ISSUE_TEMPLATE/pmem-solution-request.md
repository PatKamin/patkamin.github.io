# Requirements

 - The solution MUST use persistent memory. It doesn't matter who the persistent memory vendor is or what platform(s) it runs on.
 - The solution SHOULD be production quality and generally available for others to use as-is or in part.
    - The solution SHOULD NOT be a 'science experiment'. We whole heartedly encourage innovation, however, these solutions are best announced and discussed in the [PMem Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/pmem?pli=1). 
    - The solution should not be in Alpha, Beta, or a pre-production stage of development
    - You should provide some level of support to users of your solution, e.g.: GitHub Issues, Forum, a web support portal, or paid support contract

	 - Software solutions should be available as open source projects using any publicly available license type or commercially available either directly from the vendor/ISV or through a reseller, OEM, or ODM
	 - Hardware solutions should be available for purchase in the public domain either directly from the vendor or through a reseller, OEM, or ODM

	- If your solution falls into multiple categories, choose a primary category and use tags

# FAQ
Q) I don't see an existing category for my solution, what do I do?
A) The respository is constantly evolving, so feel free to recommend a category in your submission and the reviewer(s) will decide if a new category is required, or discuss the matter with you.

Q) I don't see any Tags that apply to my solution, what do I do?
A) Tags are intended as free-form input by the submitter, so you're welcome to create your own (Limit 5). Tags are not displayed nor used as part of filters within the repository. This is a future enhancement.
